## Future Features

## **Thoughts about projects:**
projects could be anythings related to code and computer world (by "Computer world" I mean Computer Science and Engineering). even links of articles in other platforms (like [Medium](https://meduim.com) or something like this) or a graphical UI/UX design. anything. other developers can contribute in projects. \
the field could be anything. about Web development (front and back), Mobile app development, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks, System Architecture and design, database design, UI/UX design and so on.

## Possible future ideas 

1. **Sell the source code**:\
Sharing the live project link and sell the source code to other developers. developers can share a simple description of their project and even a link to live project and sell the source (it can be custom price or just for a cup of coffee).

2. **Build tutorial series and blog posts**:\
build blog posts in format of markdown (for better sample code representation also images). this is not about sharing code or project. it's about sharing knowledge and techniques in any field related to Computer World.

3. **Primium membership**: \
projects that are big enough to considered as a organizatoin or startup (not just a personal projects) or some developers that their activities are more that average, can get primium membership which give them more possibilities like some reports about views, comments and so on.
